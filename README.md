# Course Registration System
> An application that allows instructors to enter details of courses, students and schedules through a GUI and register them. It also allows users to track payments made by students and automatically generates consecutive terms for courses. The application can export these details to a CSV file.

## General Information
### The Problem
An educational academy in Singapore that runs STEM courses keeps track of all its details (ranging from student and course registrations to payment records) using a spreadsheet. As the academy grows, they have to maintain more records. Thus, using spreadsheets becomes inefficient and cumbersome. It is error prone due to lack of validation, data normalization and there is substantial repetition of information. Overall, the process is time-consuming and tedious.

## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_

## Room for Improvement
- An additional field can be added during Course Creation stage that segregates the courses into two, “Regular Courses” and “Holiday Camps”. Based on this, further operations can be done for each category.

- As of now, the users must choose from a fixed number of Course names. In the future, as the academy grows, they may have more names to offer. Thus a feature that allows them to add, delete and edit course names to the current list could be included.

- Along with generation of reports in the form of text files, PDF reports can be generated. These could be treated as certificates for students that indicate they have completed a course. Moreover, the application could provide the ability to connect to a printer and print reports as and when required by the user.
